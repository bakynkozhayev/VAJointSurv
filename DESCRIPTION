Description: Provides function to estiamte joint marker (longitudinal) and 
    and survival (time-to-event) outcomes using variational approxiamtions.
    The functions support multivariate markers allowing for possibly 
    correlated error terms and multiple types of survival outcomes which may be
    left-truncated, right-censored, and recurrent.
