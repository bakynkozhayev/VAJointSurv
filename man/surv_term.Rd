\usage{
surv_term(
  formula,
  id,
  data,
  time_fixef,
  ders = NULL,
  with_frailty = FALSE,
  delayed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a two-sided \code{\link{formula}} with the survival outcome
on the left-hand side and fixed effect covariates on the right-hand
side. The left-hand side needs to be a \code{\link{Surv}} object and can
be either right-censored and left-truncated.}

\item{id}{the variable for the id of each individual.}

\item{data}{\code{\link{data.frame}} with at least the time variable.}

\item{time_fixef}{the time-varying fixed effects. See .e.g.
\code{\link{poly_term}}. This is for the baseline hazard. Note that many
basis expansions has boundary knots. It is important that these are set
to cover the full range of survival times including time zero for some
expansions.}

\item{ders}{a \code{\link{list}} with \code{\link{integer}} vectors for how
the survival outcome is linked to the markers. 0 implies present values,
-1 is integral of, and 1 is the derivative. \code{NULL} implies the present
value of the random effect for all markers.}

\item{with_frailty}{\code{TRUE} if there should be a frailty term.}

\item{delayed}{a vector with an entry which is \code{TRUE} if the
left-truncation time from the survival outcome is from a delayed entry.}

\details{
The \code{time_fixef} should likely not include an intercept as this is
often included in \code{formula}.

The \code{delayed} argument is to account for delayed entry with terminal
events when observations are sampled in a way such that they must not have
had the event prior to their left-truncation time. In this case, the proper
complete data likelihood is

\deqn{\frac{a(u)h(t_{ij}\mid u)^{d_{ij}}S(t_{ij} \mid u)g(u)}{\int a(u) S(v_{ij} \mid u) du}}

and not

\deqn{a(u)h(t_{ij} \mid u)^{d_{ij}}\frac{S(t_{ij} \mid u)}{S(v_{ij} \mid u)}g(u)}

where \eqn{h} is conditional hazard, \eqn{S} is the conditional survival
function, \eqn{g} is additional conditional likelihood factors from other
outcomes, \eqn{a} is the random effect distribution, \eqn{t_{ij}} is the
observed time, \eqn{d_{ij}} is an event indicator, and \eqn{v_{ij}} is the
left truncation time.

The denominator in the proper complete likelihood becomes the expectation
over all delayed entries when a cluster has more than one delayed entry. See
van den Berg and Drepper (2016) and Crowther et al. (2016) for further
details.
